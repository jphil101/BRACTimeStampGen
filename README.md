BRAC Flow Tracker

A minimalist productivity tool to align work schedules with natural energy cycles.
🧠 What is BRAC?

The Basic Rest-Activity Cycle (BRAC) is an ultradian rhythm that governs alertness levels.

    The 90-Minute Pulse: The body naturally cycles through ~90 minutes of high-frequency brain activity.

    The Recovery Gap: These peaks are followed by ~20-minute periods of lower-frequency activity for restoration.

    Daily Flow: Unlike 24-hour circadian rhythms, BRAC repeats throughout the day and night.


✨ Key Features

    Automated Timeline: Generates a 24-hour schedule based on your wake-up time.

    Visual Distinction: Clearly separates "Deep Work" phases from "Strategic Rest."

    Responsive UI: Dark/Light mode support with a mobile-friendly layout.

    Portable: Single-file application; no installation or backend required.
